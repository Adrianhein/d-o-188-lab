#Three main types of storage in container
#1) Readable-writeable short-lived layer
#2) Persistent bind mount
#3) Podman volume


#1) Readable-writeable short-lived layer
This is just default creating layers when podman container start and process

podman exec -it test-container mkdir /test


#2) Persistent bind mount

=>SElinux labeled
=>UID permission

:Z and :z in Podman (with SELinux)
=> :Z (Exclusive) =>  Changes the SELinux label of the mounted directory so that only this container can access it. (for single-container use.)
=> :z (Shared)    =>  Labels the volume so multiple containers can access it. (for shared volumes between containers.)
=> -v    OR     --volume

podman run -d --name test-container -p 8080:80 -v $HOME/test:/var/www/html:z httpd:latest 
podman run -d --name test-container -p 8080:80 -v $HOME/test:/var/www/html:Z httpd:latest 

#3) Podman volume
#podman volume is managed by podman 
#benefit of podman volume is that can be used with multiple write operations
