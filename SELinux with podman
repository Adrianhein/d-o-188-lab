#SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)  is a powerful security layer built into Linux that uses mandatory access control (MAC) to restrict what users and processes can do â€” even if the user have root access.

#getenforce                                                              (checking SELinux mode)
#sestatus                                                                (checking SELinux status)

#ls -Zld /directory                                                      (viewing context)
